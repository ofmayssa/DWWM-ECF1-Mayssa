Cinema Neon Dynasty - Website
Cinema Neon Dynasty is a website dedicated to cinema, focusing on films with special effects (SFX). The site includes a homepage presenting the cinema, a films page listing currently showing movies with ticket availability, and a contact page. Users can easily navigate between pages, explore the cinema’s films, and check or reserve tickets.
Installation and Local Use
To run the project locally, first clone the repository by running git clone <REPOSITORY_URL> (replace <REPOSITORY_URL> with the actual GitHub link). Navigate into the project folder with cd cinema-neon-dynasty. Open index.html in your browser to view the site. Optionally, you can use a local server like VSCode Live Server, WAMP, or MAMP.
Deployment Instructions
Ensure all files are prepared, including compiled HTML, CSS, JS, and images. Check that all relative paths are correct. Use the client’s hosting via FTP (e.g., FileZilla) or deploy via Git if the host supports it. For GitHub Pages, push the code to GitHub, go to Settings > Pages, select the main branch and root folder, and the site will be live at https://your-username.github.io/cinema-neon-dynasty. After deployment, test the site on multiple browsers such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, and check responsiveness on PC and mobile.
Development Workflow with Git
Create a new branch with git checkout -b feature-name. Make your changes, stage them with git add ., and commit using git commit -m "Description of the change". Push the branch with git push origin feature-name and open a Pull Request on GitHub to merge updates into the main branch. Contributors should follow the existing project structure, test changes locally, and write clear commit messages.
Project Structure
The project structure includes index.html, contact.html, movies.html, the /css/ folder for styles, the /scss/ folder for source SCSS, the /js/ folder for JavaScript, the /img/ folder for images, and the README.md file.
Screenshots and Documentation
Insert screenshots of the homepage, films page, and mobile view. Include Figma mockups, navigation and site structure diagrams, and screenshots of tests conducted on Safari, Chrome, PC, and mobile. Include relevant code excerpts such as SASS mixins or JavaScript features.
